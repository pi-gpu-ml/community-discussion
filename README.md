# What's this?

The purpose of this repository is to organize group discussion in order to make progress towards GPU-accelerated Machine Learning on Raspberry Pi computers.

# Problem statement

Currently, there is no open source set of tools to take advantage of the Pi's GPU for machine learning applications. There are over [19 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#cite_note-RapsberryPi3B+Release-1) Raspberry Pi single board computers in the world. They are low cost (starting at $5), off-the-shelf, globally available devices. While they are being used for many various purposes such as IoT hubs, educational platforms, server clusters, etc., they are not a good platform for fast and efficient machine learning applications. Possessing a [relatively fast](https://twitter.com/msurguy/status/1022345010878935041) Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU, they have the capability to become a workhorse of ML researchers, students, educators and others interested in machine learning applications. 

# Path towards a solution

In order to make a set of tools that will enable usage of Raspberry Pi's GPU for machine learning applications, a community of researchers, engineers, software architects and others contributors needs to form and work together. This repository will serve as the place for discussion, planning and involvement of such community. There are concrete steps that need to be jointly outlined, distributed and solved so that we reach the goal of democratizing Raspberry Pi's GPU for machine learning. As the community gets involved, these steps will get outlined in the [issues](https://github.com/pi-gpu-ml/community-discussion/issues) section of this repository.

# Benefits

When there is an open source solution that takes advantage of Raspberry Pi GPU for machine learning applications, we can expect many uses of the developed technology. Examples of its usage are:
- Image classification and recognition
- Audio classification and recognition
- Sensor data classification and recognition
- Actuator / motor control systems
- Etc.
